First Steps
===========

To get started, you'll first need to clone the repository, which contains essential scripts for various operating systems.
After cloning, you will use these scripts to install the necessary foundational software.
Finally, you will complete the repository-specific installation to set up your environment correctly.
Detailed instructions for each of these steps are provided below.

Repository-Specific Installation
--------------------------------

After installing the basic software, you need to perform installation steps specific to the `io-template-app` repository.
This involves setting up project-specific dependencies and environment configurations.
To perform the repository-specific installation, the following steps should be performed in a command prompt or a terminal window (depending on the operating system) the repository directory.

Setting Up the Python Environment
.................................

To begin, you'll need to set up the Python environment using Miniconda, which is already pre-installed.
You can use the provided Makefile for managing the environment.

a. For **production** use, run the following command:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   make conda-prod

b. For **software development**, use the following command:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   make conda-dev

These commands will create and configure a virtual environment for your Python project, ensuring a clean and reproducible development or production environment.
The virtual environment is automatically activated by the Makefile, so you don't need to activate it manually.

Minor Adjustments for GDAL
..........................

The installation of the GDAL library requires the following minor operating system-specific adjustments:

a. macOS
~~~~~~~~

In macOS, the GDAL library must be installed as follows:

.. code-block:: zsh

   brew install gdal

b. Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~

In Ubuntu, the GDAL library must be installed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev

c. Windows 10/11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming that Miniconda is installed in the following file directory

.. code-block:: batch

   C:\ProgramData\miniconda3

then the following entry must then be added to the path variable:;

.. code-block:: batch

   C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\envs\iotemplateapp\Library\bin

System Testing with Unit Tests
..............................

If you have previously executed `make conda-dev`, you can now perform a system test to verify the installation using `make test`.
Follow these steps:

a. Run the System Test:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Execute the system test using the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make tests

   This command will initiate the system tests using the previously installed components to verify the correctness of your installation.

b. Review the Test Results:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   After the tests are completed, review the test results in the terminal. Ensure that all tests pass without errors.

   If any tests fail, review the error messages to identify and resolve any issues with your installation.

Running system tests using `make tests` is a valuable step to ensure that your installation is working correctly, and your environment is properly configured for your project.
It helps identify and address any potential problems early in the development process.

Downloading Database Files (Optional)
.....................................

Database files can be downloaded from the IO-Aero Google Drive directory
`io_aero_data/TO DO/database/TO DO` to your local repository directory `data`.
Before extracting, if a `postgres` directory exists within the `data` directory, it should be deleted.

Follow these steps to manage the database files:

a. Access the IO-Aero Google Drive Directory:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to the IO-Aero Google Drive and locate the directory `io_aero_data/TO DO/database/TO DO`.

b. Download Database Files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the necessary database files from the specified directory to your local repository directory `data`.

c. Delete Existing `postgres` Directory (if present):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a directory named `postgres` already exists within the `data` directory, you should delete it to avoid conflicts.

d. Extract Database Files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The downloaded database files are in an archive format (ZIP) and should be extracted in the `data` directory.
After completing these steps, the database files should reside in the `data` directory of your local repository and will be ready for use.

Creating the Docker Container with PostgreSQL DB
.................................................

To create the Docker container with PostgreSQL database software, you can use the provided `run_io_template_app` script.
Depending on your operating system, follow the relevant instructions below:

a. macOS (zsh):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: zsh

   ./scripts/run_io_template_app.zsh s_d_c

b. Ubuntu (sh):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   ./scripts/run_io_template_app.sh s_d_c

c. Windows 10/11 (cmd):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: batch

   scripts\run_io_template_app.cmd s_d_c

These commands will initiate the process of creating the Docker container with PostgreSQL database software.
