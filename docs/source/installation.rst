- **Windows**: The ``run_install_aws_cli.bat`` script is intended for Windows users. It automates the process of downloading and installing the latest version of the AWS CLI in the Windows Command Prompt environment.

Each script is named following the pattern ``run_install_aws_cli.<ext>``, with ``<ext>`` being the respective script extension suitable for the target operating system and shell environment (e.g., `.bat` for Windows CMD, `.sh` for Ubuntu Bash, `.zsh` for macOS Zsh). Users are advised to execute the corresponding script for their operating system to achieve an optimal AWS CLI installation experience.

Miniconda
---------

The ``scripts`` directory includes a collection of operating system-specific scripts named ``run_install_miniconda`` to streamline the installation of Miniconda. These scripts are designed to cater to the needs of different environments, making the setup process efficient and user-friendly.

- **Ubuntu Bash Shell**: The necessary software can be downloaded with the package manager ``apt`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install -y unixodbc-dev

- **macOS Zsh Shell**: The necessary software can be downloaded with the package manager ``Homebrew`` as follows:

.. code-block:: zsh

    brew update
    brew install unixodbc

DBeaver - optional
------------------

DBeaver is an optional but highly recommended tool for this software as it offers a user-friendly interface to gain insights into the database internals. The project provides convenient scripts for installing DBeaver on macOS and Ubuntu.

- **macOS**: The ``run_install_dbeaver.zsh`` script is crafted for macOS systems. By running this Zsh script, users can easily install DBeaver and quickly connect to the database for management and querying tasks.

- **Ubuntu**: For Ubuntu users, the ``run_install_dbeaver.sh`` script facilitates the installation of DBeaver. This Bash script automates the setup process, adding necessary repositories and handling the installation seamlessly.

- **Windows**: Windows users are advised to download and install DBeaver using the official installer from the DBeaver website at `DBeaver Download <https://dbeaver.io/download/>`_. The installer ensures that DBeaver is properly configured and optimized for Windows environments.

To install DBeaver, locate the appropriate script in the ``scripts`` directory for macOS or Ubuntu. If you're a Windows user, please use the provided link to access the official installer for an intuitive installation experience.

Python Libraries
----------------

The project's Python dependencies are managed partly through Conda and partly through pip. To facilitate a straightforward installation process, a Makefile is provided at the root of the project.

- **Development Environment**: Run the command ``make conda-dev`` from the terminal to set up a development environment. This will install the necessary Python libraries using Conda and pip as specified for development purposes.

- **Production Environment**: Execute the command ``make conda-prod`` for preparing a production environment. It ensures that all the required dependencies are installed following the configurations optimized for production deployment.

The Makefile targets abstract away the complexity of managing multiple package managers and streamline the environment setup. It is crucial to have both Conda and the appropriate pip tool available in your system's PATH to utilize the Makefile commands successfully.
